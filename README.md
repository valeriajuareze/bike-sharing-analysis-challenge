# NYC CitiBike Analysis for August 2019

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, showing the most popular stations in NYC for starting and ending a bike journey, and also creating a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all rides and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week 

## Results

### Summary

According to the previous visualizations, we can deduce that CitiBike is often used during labor hours, specifically, entry and exit time of workers, so the people in NYC think that a bike joruney is a better option than spend hours in traffick, which is converting in a necessity. So, for a further analysis, my recommendation is to first analize and compare the traffick between NYC and Des Moines, specifically during the labor hours, and finally, analize if Des Moines is an appropriate city to have a huge company of bike journeys such as CitiBike.
